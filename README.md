# Thunder-Electricals-Performance-Dashboard
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed for a regional distributor to analyze sales, profit, and unit movement, transforming raw data into actionable geographic and product-level intelligence.
## what are the questions answered ?
1.Financial Health: What is the Overall Profit Margin for the business, and how does it compare between the Agriculture and Home Needs product categories?

2.Geographic Risk: Which state is currently contributing the most Profit versus which state is incurring the largest Loss?

3.Product Strategy: What is the sales volume for a product (Units Sold) versus its financial contribution (Total Sale), helping to distinguish between low-margin volume drivers and high-margin value drivers?

4.Tactical Focus: Which specific products are driving the most profit, and which need immediate review due to low profit margins despite high sales?

## what are the insights I got from the Dashboard ?

By comparing the distribution of Units Sold (high volume in Agriculture) against Total Sale (62% driven by Home Needs), it was determined that Home Needs is the strategic value driver. The recommendation was to shift investment and resources toward the high-margin Home Needs category.
